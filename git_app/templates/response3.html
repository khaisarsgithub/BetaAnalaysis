  <h1>isoftpull Repository Review</h1>
  <h2>Code Quality</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Readability</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The code is generally readable, with clear variable and function names.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are some areas where comments could be improved. For example, in the `CreditBureausController`'s `index` method, there is a comment indicating that a credit bureau could be created. This comment would be more helpful if it explained the conditions under which a credit bureau could be created.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are some areas where the code could be more concise. For example, in the `Applicant` model's `remove_whitespace_from_applicant_details` method, the code could be simplified by using the `strip!` method.
        </li>
        <li>
          The code could be more consistent in its use of indentation. For example, in the `Applicant` model's `custom_fields` method, the indentation is inconsistent.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Maintainability</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The code is generally maintainable, with a well-defined structure and separation of concerns.
        </li>
        <li>
          The code could be more modular. For example, the `IntelligenceWaterfall` class could be broken down into smaller classes that handle specific tasks, such as running a single intelligence or validating the results.     
        </li>
        <li>
          The code could be more testable. For example, the `IntelligenceWaterfall` class could be made more testable by using dependency injection to inject the dependencies that are required.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Structure</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The code is generally well-structured, with a clear separation of concerns.
        </li>
        <li>
          The code could be more organized. For example, the `app/controllers/concerns` directory could be organized into subdirectories based on the concerns that they handle.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Naming Conventions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Variable and function names are generally clear and descriptive.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are some areas where the naming could be improved. For example, the `Applicant` model's `check_duplicate_validation` attribute could be renamed to `validate_duplicate_applicants`.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Comments</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The code is generally well-commented, but there are some areas where the comments could be improved.    
        </li>
        <li>
          Comments should explain why the code is written the way it is, not just what the code does.
        </li>
        <li>
          Comments should be kept up-to-date with the code.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Documentation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The code is generally well-documented, but there are some areas where the documentation could be improved.
        </li>
        <li>
          The documentation should be consistent in its style and formatting.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Design Patterns</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The code uses a variety of design patterns, including the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and the Singleton pattern.
        </li>
        <li>
          The use of design patterns is generally appropriate, but there are some areas where the use of design patterns could be improved. For example, the `IntelligenceWaterfall` class could be designed using the Strategy pattern to make it more flexible.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Coding Standards</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The code follows a consistent coding style, but there are some areas where the coding style could be improved.
        </li>
        <li>
          The code could be more consistent in its use of indentation. For example, in the `Applicant` model's `custom_fields` method, the indentation is inconsistent.
        </li>
        <li>
          The code could be more consistent in its use of whitespace. For example, in the `Applicant` model's `custom_fields` method, the whitespace is inconsistent.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Hard-coded Secrets</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The code uses environment variables to store sensitive information, such as API keys and passwords. This is a good practice, as it prevents sensitive information from being stored directly in the code.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Input Validation and Sanitization</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The code generally validates and sanitizes user input, but there are some areas where the input validation and sanitization could be improved.
        </li>
        <li>
          For example, in the `Applicant` model's `ssn=` method, the code sanitizes the SSN by removing underscores and hyphens. However, the code does not validate that the SSN is a valid format.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Insecure Dependencies</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The code uses a number of dependencies, including `devise`, `activeadmin`, and `doorkeeper`.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is important to keep all dependencies up-to-date, as outdated dependencies can contain security vulnerabilities.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Secure Coding Practices</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The code generally follows secure coding practices, but there are some areas where the secure coding practices could be improved.
        </li>
        <li>
          For example, in the `Api::V2::BaseController`'s `handle_tokens` method, the code does not validate the API key or secret token before using them.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Best Practices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Encryption</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The code uses Active Record Encryption to encrypt sensitive data, such as the SSN. This is a good practice, as it helps to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Secure Communication</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The code uses HTTPS to secure communication between the client and the server. This is a good practice, as it helps to protect sensitive information from being intercepted by third parties.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Sensitive Information</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The code generally handles sensitive information securely, but there are some areas where the handling of sensitive information could be improved.
        </li>
        <li>
          For example, in the `Api::V2::BaseController`'s `handle_tokens` method, the code does not validate the API key or secret token before using them.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>User Authentication</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The code uses Devise to handle user authentication. This is a good practice, as it provides a robust and secure authentication system.
        </li>
        <li>
          The code also uses Devise Security to enhance the security of the authentication system. This is a good practice, as it helps to protect the system from common security attacks.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Error Handling</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The code generally handles errors gracefully, but there are some areas where the error handling could be improved.
        </li>
        <li>
          For example, in the `Api::V2::BaseController`'s `handle_tokens` method, the code does not handle the case where the API token is not found.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Performance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Efficiency</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The code is generally efficient, but there are some areas where the code could be optimized for performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          For example, in the `Applicant` model's `custom_fields` method, the code could be optimized by using a more efficient data structure to store the additional fields.
        </li>
        <li>
          The code could be more efficient in its use of database queries. For example, the `IntelligenceWaterfall` class could be optimized by using a single query to retrieve all of the intelligences that need to be run.      
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Algorithms</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The code uses a number of algorithms, including the bcrypt algorithm for password hashing and the RSA algorithm for encryption.
        </li>
        <li>
          The choice of algorithms is generally appropriate, but there are some areas where the choice of algorithms could be improved. For example, the code could use a more efficient hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256, for password hashing.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Data Structures</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The code uses a variety of data structures, including arrays, hashes, and sets.
        </li>
        <li>
          The choice of data structures is generally appropriate, but there are some areas where the choice of data structures could be improved. For example, the `Applicant` model's `additional_fields` attribute could be stored in a more efficient data structure, such as a hash.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Overall</h2>
